			On March of 2013 Andorra held a public design competition for all
			denominations except for the €2 denomination which the government
			pre-decided would bear the coat of arms of Andorra.  Each set of

			The results of the design contest with a few modifications are what
			became the coins that entered circulation in 2014.  While each set
			of denomations has its own design, all four designs promenantly
			feature the country name ‘ANDORRA’ along the outer portion of the
			design with the year of issue written underneath.

			The Andorran 1-, 2-, and 5 euro cent coins all feature the same
			design of a Pyrenean chamois in the center of the coin with a
			golden eagle flying above.  Both animals are native to Andorra as
			well as the surrounding regions of France and Spain.

			The Andorran golden cents feature the Romanesque church of Santa
			Coloma.  The church is the oldest in Andorra, dating back to the
			9th century and is a UNESCO World Heratige site.  Originally these
			coins were planned to depict an image of Christ, but that plan
			failed to go through after objections from the European Commission
			on grounds of religious neutrality on August 2013.

			The 1 Euro coin features the Case de la Vall: the former
			headquarters of the General Council of Andorra.  It was constructed
			in 1580 as a manor and tower defense by the Busquets family.

			Finally, the 2 Euro coin features the coat of arms of Andorra.  The
			Andorran coat of arms is a grid of 4 other coats of arms which from
