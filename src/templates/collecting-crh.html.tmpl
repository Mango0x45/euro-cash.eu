	<h2>{{ .Get "What is Coin Roll Hunting?" }}</h2>
	<p>
		{{ .Get "Coin roll hunting is a popular method of coin collecting in which you withdraw cash from your bank in the form of coins and then search through those coins to find new additions to your collection. Once you’ve searched through all your coins, you will typically deposit your left over coins at the bank and withdraw new coins." }}
	</p>

	<p>
		{{ .Get "This type of coin collecting is often called ‘coin roll hunting’ (abbreviated to ‘CRH’) due to the fact that banks will often provide you with coins in the form of paper-wrapped rolls. You may however find that your coins come in plastic bags instead (common in countries like Ireland)." }}
	</p>

	<p>
		{{ .Get "Depending on your bank and branch, the process of obtaining coins may differ. Some banks require you speak to a teller while others have coin machines. Some banks may also require that you are a customer or even that you have a business account. If you aren’t sure about if you can get coins we suggest you contact your bank, although further down this page we also have additional information about the withdrawal of coins in various countries and major banks." }}
	</p>

	<h2>{{ .Get "Getting Started" }}</h2>
	<p>
		{{ .Get "To get started with coin roll hunting you should first contact your bank or check their website to find details regarding coin withdrawal. You will then typically need to go to the bank to pick up your coins. Depending on your bank you may be able to withdraw coins from a machine. Most banks will charge you a small fee per roll and/or transaction." }}
	</p>

	<p>
		{{ .Get "It is also important to find details regarding the deposit of coins. Depositing coins often also requires the payment of a fee — one which is typically more expensive than the withdrawal fees. If depositing your coins is too expensive you can always exchange your left over coins at shops for banknotes. It is often cheaper (or even free) to deposit banknotes." }}
	</p>

	<p>
		{{ .Get "In some countries such as Austria it is even common to be able to withdraw new coins from your account using other coins." }}
