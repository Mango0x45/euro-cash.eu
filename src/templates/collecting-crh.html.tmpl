	<h2>{{ .T "What is Coin Roll Hunting?" }}</h2>
	<p>
		{{ .T `
			Coin roll hunting is a popular method of coin collecting in which
			you withdrawal cash from your bank in the form of coins which you
			then search through to find new additions to your collection.  Once
			you’ve searched through all your coins, you will typically deposit
			your left over coins at the bank and withdrawal new coins.
		` }}
	</p>

	<p>
		{{ .T `
			This type of coin collecting is often called ‘Coin Roll Hunting’
			due to the fact that coins are often withdrawn in paper-wrapped
			rolls.  You may however find that your coins come in plastic bags
			instead (common in countries like Ireland).
		` }}
	</p>

	<p>
		{{ .T `
			Depending on your bank and branch, the process of obtaining coins
			may differ.  Some banks require you speak to a teller, others have
			coin machines.  Some banks may also require that you are a customer
			or even to have a business account.  If you aren’t sure about if
			you can get coins we suggest you contact your bank, although
			further down this page we also have information about the
			withdrawal of coins in various countries and major banks.
		` }}
	</p>

	<h2>{{ .T "Getting Started" }}</h2>
	<p>
		{{ .T `
			To get started with coin roll hunting you should first contact your
			bank or check their website to find details regarding coin
			withdrawal.  You will then typically need to go to the bank to pick
			up your coins.  Depending on your bank you may be able to
			withdrawal coins from a machine, although often you can pick up
			your coins from the banks tellers.  You will also often need to pay
			a small fee for each roll, although some banks don’t charge fees.
		` }}
	</p>

	<p>
		{{ .T `
			It is also important to find details regarding the deposit of
			coins.  Depositing coins often also requires the payment of a fee
			— one which is typically more expensive than the withdrawal fees.
			If depositing your coins is too expensive you can always exchange
			your left over coins at shops for banknotes.  It is often cheaper
			(or even free) to deposit banknotes.
		` }}
	</p>

	<p>
		{{ .T `
			In some countries such as Austria it is even common to be able to
			withdrawal new coins from your account by exchanging the left over
			coins you already have.
		` }}
	</p>

	<h2>{{ .T "Country-Specific Details" }}</h2>
	<p>
		{{ .T `
			Below you can find all sorts of country-specific information we
			have regarding obtaining coin rolls.  We lack a lot of information
			for many of the countries, so if you have any additional
			information such as your banks fees, the availability of coin roll
			machines, etc. feel free to contact us!  You can find our contact
			information %shere%s.`
